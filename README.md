# Online-payment-fraud-detection


This project implements a Machine Learning solution for detecting fraudulent transactions in online payment systems.
It utilizes various algorithms and techniques to analyze transaction data and identify patterns indicative of fraud.

Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning allows you to run automated transaction processing on an example dataset or your own dataset. The included ML model detects potentially fraudulent activity and flags that activity for review.
